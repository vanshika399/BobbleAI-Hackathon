    Question 1:Permutation of strings from a dynamic array of arrays taking a single element from each array.
    It contains two files:
    input.csv contains the input data
    and permutation.cpp contains the cplusplus code to print the required permutations of the string.
    
    To compile and run the code in Linux terminal the following commands should be used:
    sudo g++ permutation.cpp
    ./a.out input.csv
    
    Make sure the name of the file from which input is read is changed accordingly and the .csv file is in the same folder as the .cpp file.
